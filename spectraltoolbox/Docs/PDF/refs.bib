	shorttitle = {Numerical Recipes},
	abstract = {Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes Third Edition starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. Widely recognized as the most comprehensive, accessible and practical basis for scientific computing, this new edition incorporates more than 400 Numerical Recipes routines, many of them new or upgraded. The executable C++ code, now printed in color for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Please visit www.nr.com or www.cambridge.org/us/numericalrecipes for more details. New key features:  2 new chapters, 25 new sections, 25\% longer than Second Edition Thorough upgrades throughout the text Over 100 completely new routines and upgrades of many more. New Classification and Inference chapter, including Gaussian mixture models, {HMMs}, hierarchical clustering, Support Vector {MachinesNew} Computational Geometry chapter covers {KD} trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres New sections include interior point methods for linear programming, Monte Carlo Markov Chains, spectral and pseudospectral methods for {PDEs}, and many new statistical distributions An expanded treatment of {ODEs} with completely new routines  Plus comprehensive coverage of  linear algebra, interpolation, special functions, random numbers, nonlinear sets of equations, optimization, eigensystems, Fourier methods and wavelets, statistical tests, {ODEs} and {PDEs}, integral equations, and inverse theory  And much, much more!},

	abstract = {Generalized polynomial chaos {(gPC)} has non-uniform convergence and tends to break down for long-time integration. The reason is that the probability density distribution {(PDF)} of the solution evolves as a function of time. The set of orthogonal polynomials associated with the initial distribution will therefore not be optimal at later times, thus causing the reduced efficiency of the method for long-time integration. Adaptation of the set of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the changing {PDF} removes the error with respect to long-time integration. In this method new stochastic variables and orthogonal polynomials are constructed as time progresses. In the new stochastic variable the solution can be represented exactly by linear functions. This allows the method to use only low order polynomial approximations with high accuracy. The method is illustrated with a simple decay model for which an analytic solution is available and subsequently applied to the three mode {Kraichnanâ€“Orszag} problem with favorable results.},

	title = {Introduction to Numerical Analysis},
	isbn = {9780387954523},
	abstract = {This book contains a large amount of information not found in standard textbooks. Written for the advanced undergraduate/beginning graduate student, it combines the modern mathematical standards of numerical analysis with an understanding of the needs of the computer scientist working on practical applications. Among its many particular features are: fully worked-out examples; many carefully selected and formulated problems; fast Fourier transform methods; a thorough discussion of some important minimization methods; solution of stiff or implicit ordinary differential equations and of differential algebraic systems; modern shooting techniques for solving two-point boundary value problems; and basics of multigrid methods. This new edition features expanded presentation of Hermite interpolation and B-splines, with a new section on multi-resolution methods and B-splines. New material on differential equations and the iterative solution of linear equations include: solving differential equations in the presence of discontinuities whose locations are not known at the outset; techniques for sensitivity analyses of differential equations dependent on additional parameters; new advanced techniques in multiple shooting; and Krylov space methods for non-symmetric systems of linear equations.},
