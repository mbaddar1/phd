Boostrapped Neural ODE / Bayesian
Rely on the optimal control eqn in
"Dissecting Neural ODEs" eq(2)
so that we run initial fw / bw paths to draw a draft optimal path (warmup)
or equivalently rely on some kine of transfer learning to use a prior model to draw the path and included
loss of data plus prior info in the training (i.e. DE solution)

Depth Varying NDE <-> Time Varying DE??
in the paper Dissecting Neural ODEs, section 3 , the work related to depth-varying NDE can be
related to solving DE with Tensor , esp. for time-varying problems !
first we need to experiment whether depth/time-variance is beneficial to expressiveness
